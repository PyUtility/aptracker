All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [PEP0440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
styling guide. For full details, see the [commit logs](https://github.com/PyUtility/autoholidays/commits).

## `PEP0440` Styling Guide

<details>
<summary>Click to open <code>PEP0440</code> Styilng Guide</summary>

Packaging for `PyPI` follows the standard PEP0440 styling guide and is implemented by the **`packaging.version.Version`** class. The other
popular versioning scheme is [`semver`](https://semver.org/), but each build has different parts/mapping.
The following table gives a mapping between these two versioning schemes:

<div align = "center">

| `PyPI` Version | `semver` Version |
| :---: | :---: |
| `epoch` | n/a |
| `major` | `major` |
| `minor` | `minor` |
| `micro` | `patch` |
| `pre` | `prerelease` |
| `dev` | `build` |
| `post` | n/a |

</div>

One can use the **`packaging`** version to convert between PyPI to semver and vice-versa. For more information, check

### APTracker v1.1.0 | 2026-03-14

The "Advance Python (AP)" Project Tracker **`APTracker`** is a functional module that provides asynchronous functions to track
a project and sessions across a centralized/distributed system by creating unique session keys. The project aims to create an
unified system with minimal dependency overheads.

To explore and understand the full capabilities, upgrade to the latest version using `pip` as:

```shell
pip install -U aptracker
```

### APTracker v1.0.0 | 2026-03-13

A first stable release of a long-standing code file that I ([@ZenithClown](https://github.com/ZenithClown)) typically use for
managing sessions across multiple projects. Creating a release to register the namespace for PyPI release.

To install the package use `pip` as below:

```shell
pip install aptracker
